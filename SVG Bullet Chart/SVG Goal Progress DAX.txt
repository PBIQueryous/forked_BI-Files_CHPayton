//my dataset has no "plan", but if yours does you can use it below
//VAR MAXPlan = [Profit Plan]
//the two vars below are just summing goal and actual values for the latest FY - nothing fancy.

VAR PERCENTAGEFILL = MAXActual/AXISRANGE*118  //Note: the number that is being multiplied here is essentially what you want the max width of these to be; I have it a couple pixels smaller than the width of the track so that there is a tiny bit of breathing room
VAR PERCENTAGETARGET = MAXTarget/AXISRANGE*118
RETURN
//Note: In Kerry's example, the track line below referenced "&TRACKWIDTH&", which I have commented out (this data has no "plan", so I just set the width to a static value)
//she also had a HASONEVALUE() in the return clause to prevent a "totals" bar from being displayed; I took that out so that we have an overall progress bar
//previously, you needed to set a width and height for the SVG in the SVG tag, but since we're now setting it with visual settings we can remove it (it was width='120' height='24' previously)
